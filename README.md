# Tile Adventure Game

## Overview

Tile Adventure is a mobile-friendly, browser-based adventure game built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. Players navigate a tile-based world map, encounter random D&D-style events, and manage a character with stats and an inventory system. The game features turn-based encounters with dice rolls influenced by character stats, an experience system for leveling up, and item collection.

## Features

- **Tile-Based Map**: Explore a grid of grass and forest tiles.
- **Random Encounters**: Face combat, traps, or NPC interactions with a 40% chance per move.
- **Character Stats**: Health, strength, speed, and charisma affect encounter outcomes via D20 rolls.
- **Inventory System**: Collect items like Health Potions, Swords, and Gold Coins.
- **Experience System**: Gain XP to level up, increasing stats and max health.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized for touch controls on mobile browsers.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser, preferably on a mobile device.
2. Use the on-screen buttons (Up, Left, Right, Down) to move the red square (player) across the map.
3. Each move may trigger an encounter (combat, trap, or NPC). Choose to attempt or flee:
   - **Attempt**: Rolls a D20 modified by the relevant stat (strength, speed, or charisma).
   - **Success**: Gain 10 XP and a chance to find an item. At 20 XP per level, level up to boost stats.
   - **Failure**: Lose 2 health. If health reaches 0, the game restarts.
4. Monitor your stats and inventory above the map.
